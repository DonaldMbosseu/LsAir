# LsAir
 This is a system develop to be able to analyse and extract metrics 
from travellerâ€™s behaviour, airlines operations, and a general overview of the functioning of this 
industry. To do so, I am required to develop the necessary software to be able to comply with 
each of the requirements of the statement. 
The goals of this project are to consolidate the development of queries, triggers and events using the 
techniques and tools learn throughout the second semester. Furthermore, another goal of this project 
is implementing a graph-based database using the Neo4J software learned. 
This project is divided in two main parts, the first one consisting of 5 different requirements in which 
I have to solve multiple queries, triggers and events. The second part is based on two case studies 
on Neo4J
