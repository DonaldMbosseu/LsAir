# :plane: Summary - LsAir
LSAIR has been implemented as a MySQL database comprising more than forty tables
highly interrelated. LSAIR can answer questions like how many people have travelled to a
particular destination, which is the airport which has more flights, and which airplanes haven
‘t been maintained for the last month. However, the database requires some updates to
answer complex queries and to figure-it out the relations between passengers.
A major update is to find relations between people, to do so, part of the information of the
LSAIR database will be migrated to a graph database which excels in social network
analysis.

# :computer: 
•To update LSAIR relational database by implementing: new queries, tables, triggers
and events.
• To design and implement a LSAIR graph-based database with data from LSAIR
relational database.

# :book: Summary
This project is divided in two main parts, the first one consisting of 5 different requirements in which 
I have to solve multiple queries, triggers and events. The second part is based on two case studies 
on Neo4J.

# :notebook: Queries
The queries to write and execute can all be found in the project statement above,
and all the queries done in the SQLScripts above.
